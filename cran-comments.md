## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added single quotes around package and software names 
  (e.g. 'ECHO') in the title and description
  
* Explained all acronyms in the description

* Replaced \dontrun{} with \donttest{} and added comment 
  that an internet connection is required to run the examples 

# 0.1.0

* Initial release

## Test environments

* local Windows 10, R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.4

* Note: This is a new submission

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
